# Blogs-Api

**This project was developed with the aim of building a Node.js application using Sequelize to create a CRUD for a blog, allowing users to create, edit, read, and delete posts.**

**Multiple endpoints were created to meet each requirement, following REST principles. A validation token was also implemented for the endpoints, ensuring that only a user who has been created can create a post, and only the user who created a post can update or delete it.**
